<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Here Tufikami will add the explanation of what the paradigm does




### Built With

* [Presentation® NeuroBehavioral Systems](https://www.neurobs.com/menu_presentation/menu_features/features_overview)






## Timing, settings and Readme files

### Timing
The timing of this paradigm was checked around November 2018. We found out there is a 12ms delay between the trigger onset and the start of the sound. The following is the time between the stimuli per block:

ASSR40_900 - 25ms between stim
ASSR16_500 - 63ms between stim
ASSR40_500 - 25ms between stim


### settings
We used [in-ear earphones](https://www.etymotic.com/product/er1-insert-earphones/) and tested that the volume was around 74dB when we would put the presentation volume (which is the same as the windows volume) to 0.35. Because of the quality of the earplugs, we would not measure the dB for every participant, but we would take note to be sure that the volume always was at 35%.

We alwayed used presentation V20.1

You can see [the rest of the paradigm settings here](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/ASSR/tree/main/src/Settings%20%2B%20setup%20%2B%20timing)


### Readme files
All readme files are .txt files and use the following structure: 
~~~~---***run in presentation V 20.1***---~~~
